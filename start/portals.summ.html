<H2>Abstract</H2>
<P>Portals have been added to 4.4BSD as an experimental feature
and are in the publicly-available 4.4BSD-Lite distribution.  Portals
provide access to alternate file types or devices using names in
the normal filesystem that a process just opens.  For example, an
open of the file "/p/tcp/ftp.uu.net/smtp" returns a socket descriptor
to the calling process that is connected to the SMTP server on the
specified host.  By providing access through the normal filesystem,
the calling process need not be aware of the special system calls
necessary to create a TCP socket and establish a TCP connection.
This makes TCP connections, for example, available to normal programs
such as cat and awk.

<P>This paper describes the implementation of portals in 4.4BSD as
another type of filesystem and provides some examples.  It also compares
portals to the System V Release 4 "connld" streams module, which provides
similar capabilities.
