Typos and errors found in "UNIX Network Programming"
(Last updated April 1, 1997)

Note: If you fetched this file using anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net,
      be aware that a more current copy can probably be found at
      the home page http://www.kohala.com/~rstevens.

- p.  2: Two 1200 baud modems and a phone line are required to hook together 
	 two personal computers, not one.  Also, the term "bps" is really
	 better than "baud".

- p. 44: In Figure 2.4 the description for SIGCONT should be "Continue
	 after SIGTSTP or SIGSTOP".

- p. 53: 4th sentence in next to last paragraph: "If we called sigblock first,
	 to unblock the signal" should be "If we called sigsetmask first,".

- p. 59: Item 2 at top of page: "If the pathname argument to execlp or
	 execvp" should be "if the filename argument to execlp or execvp".

- p. 62: Second line on the page should refer to Figure 2.4, not Figure 2.3.

- p. 73: 6th line from top of page: "have by the following characteristics"
	 should be "have the following characteristics".

- p. 99: First line: the #define of LOCKFILE isn't needed, since it's
	 never used.

- p. 103: Caption for Figure 3.5 should start "Pipe between two processes".

- p. 113: 4th line of 2nd paragraph: "FIFO2 for writing" should be "FIFO2
	  for reading".

- p. 212: 3rd paragraph: "We show how a user process can set the TCP push flag".
	  There is no way for a user application to explicitly set this flag.
	  It's set automatically by TCP.

- p. 212: Last paragraph: the maximum size of an IP datagram is 65535 bytes,
	  not 65536.

- p. 217: Next to last sentence of 2nd paragraph: "six hexadecimal digits"
	  should be "six hexadecimal numbers".

- p. 229: 3rd line: "Figure 5.21" should be "in Figure 5.21".

- p. 251: Under "Electronic Mail", 2nd line of 2nd paragraph: delete "the
	  interactive user".

- p. 274: In the pseudo code at the top of the page, the calls to bind() and
          listen() are missing "if (".

- p. 275: First line: "one of the following" should be "one or more of
	  the following".

- p. 277: End of 2nd line on page: "otherwise its nonzero." should be
	  "otherwise it's nonzero."

- p. 280: The end of the writen() function is simpler as "return(nbytes)"
	  since nleft is 0.

- p. 283: In the call to recvfrom() in the function dg_cli(), some systems
	  (SunOS 4.x for example) don't allow the 6th argument to be a null
	  pointer.  On these systems you should declare an integer (int len;),
	  set it to 0 before the call to recvfrom (len = 0;) and then pass a
	  pointer to this integer as the 6th argument (&len).

- p. 302: In the prototype for getsockname(), the name "peer" for the second
	  argument is really a misnomer.  A better name would be "local".

- p. 325: For SIOCGARP the final word of the first sentence should be
	  "table", not "entry".

- p. 337: Item 2, 1st line: "is executed for every socket" should be "is
	  executed for the socket".

- p. 344: Below Figure 7.2: "which is shown in Figure 6.2." should be "which
	  is shown in Figure 6.3."

- p. 365: The assignment of &serv_addr to callptr->addr.buf is incorrect.
	  Since t_alloc() allocated the structure, it allocated memory for
	  the server address and stored the pointer in addr.buf.  In the
	  example in the book, this assignment causes no harm, but if the
	  example were to call t_free() two things would happen: t_free()
	  would try and release the memory occupied by the automatic variable
	  serv_addr, and the original memory allocated by t_alloc() would
	  never be freed (i.e., a memory leak).

- p. 413: Same potential error in the call to recvfrom() as noted on p. 283
	  above.

- p. 449: In the ping program, the function inet_ntoa() is called with the
	  wrong type of argument (a "u_long" instead of a "struct in_addr").
	  The call in main() on this page should be
		inet_ntoa(dest.sin_addr);

- p. 456: The third line of C code from the bottom of the page:
		from->sin_addr.s_addr = ntohl( ...);
	  should be removed.

- p. 457: There are three calls to inet_ntoa() on this page with the wrong
	  type of argument.  Replace all three with
		inet_ntoa(from->sin_addr)

- p. 564: Last line of page: "rhsd server" should be "rshd server".

- p. 701: One-third of the way down the page: "We'll use a simple example
	  to shows", "shows" should be "show".

- p. 706: Last sentence of item 3: "When the response if received" should
	  be "When the response is received".

- p. 749: The entry for BBN should not have a comma after "Bolt".  Similar
	  fix for the entry "Bolt, Beranek and Newman".

- p. 763: Delete index entry for "rhsd server".

The following errors are corrected in the 8th printing (check the copyright
page to see if the last number above the ISBN is 8 or greater.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- p. xi: Last paragraph of Preface: Update e-mail address to "rstevens@noao.edu"
	 and state that examples are available at ftp.uu.net in the file
	 published/books/stevens.netprog.tar.Z.

- p. 15: Last sentence before "Argument List": "status of the program in
	 "unpredictable" should be "status of the program is unpredictable".

- p. 19: Halfway down the page: "using a disk file or some form or
	 interprocess" should be "using a disk file or some form of".

- p. 46: Item 2, halfway down the page: "All signals, other than SIGKILL"
	 should be "All signals, other than SIGKILL and SIGSTOP".

- p. 51: Second bullet item (half way down the page), second sentence:
	 "But we don't want to signal discarded" should be "But we don't
	 want the signal discarded".

- p. 68: Half way down the page, the line of output after "Executing the
	 program again yields", "prgrp" should be "pgrp".

- p. 87: Second to last sentence in first paragraph of chapter 3: "to assure
	 certain" should be "to assure".

- p. 110: 12th line from the top: "file mode access mode" should be "file
	  mode access word".

- p. 129: 17th line from the top: "len specifies" should be "length specifies".

- p. 132: 1st line: "Both of these program" should be "Both of these programs".

- p. 141: In item 3 towards the top of the page the sentence "Then the absolute
	  value of sem_op is subtracted from the semaphore's current value."
	  should be added between the two existing sentences.

- p. 141: In the comment for the "array" member of the "union semun" the
	  two constants IPC_GETALL and IPC_SETALL should be GETALL and SETALL.

- p. 146: In the comment halfway down the page: "any process that exit's"
	  should be "any process that exits" (remove single quote).

- p. 148: Halfway down the page in the code, the line
		if ( (semval = semctl(id, 1, GETVAL, 0)) < 0)
	  should be
		semctl_arg.val = 0;
		if ( (semval = semctl(id, 1, GETVAL, semctl_arg)) < 0)

	  This same type of fix (replacing the argument of 0 with the
	  actual union whose "arg" member is zero) needs to be applied
	  to the semctl() call at the bottom of p. 149 (sem_rm() function)
	  and halfway down p. 150 (sem_close() function).

- p. 148: In the line of code "err_sys("can SETVAL[0]");" 3/4 of the way down
	  the page, replace "can" with "can't".  Do the same thing 3 lines
	  down (for SETVAL[1]).

- p. 282: In the function str_cli at the top of the page, the line
	  "recvline[n] = 0; /* null terminate */" right before the call to
	  fputs can be removed, since readline stores the terminating null.

- p. 285: Near bottom of page: "if the system is a multihomed" should be
	  "if the system is multihomed".

- p. 305: The word "fileystem" 1/3 down the page should be "filesystem".

- p. 339: Halfway down page (RFC 868): Harrenstein should be Harrenstien.
	  (The bibliography entry is correct.)

- p. 350: Fig. 7.6: the two occurences of ".buff" should be ".buf".

- p. 371: First sentence: replace "Section 6.5" with "Section 7.4".

- p. 371: In the last line of Figure 7.11 replace T_UNBIND with T_UNBND.

- p. 401: In the error message after "if (port < 0)" the word "implemeneted"
	  should be "implemented".

- p. 415: In the call to fgets halfway down the page replace the second
	  argument ("MAXLINE") with "MAXLINE - sizeof(long)".

- p. 428: The comment one-third of the way down the page that starts with
	  (a) is wrong.  The last sentence of that item should say "then
	  that user name has to equal the user name on the client (cliuname)".

- p. 437: First sentence of Section 10.2: Harrenstein should be Harrenstien.
	  (The bibliography entry is correct.)

- p. 518: Fourth line of program text, describing -i option: "inted"
	  should be "inetd".

- p. 546: The comment "set to same value for now" for the variable "seqnum"
	  should be removed.

- p. 612: In the last sentence of next to last paragraph: "(Stopped) tty input"
	  should be "Stopped (tty input)".

- p. 627: The word TIOCKPT_xxx in the comment halfway down the page should be
	  TIOCPKT_xxx.

- p. 630: The comment in the middle of the page: "Get the name of the server we
	  connect to" should be "Get the port number for the rlogin service".

- p. 635: The word "haldner" in the comment preceding the sigcld_parent()
	  function should be "handler".

- p. 648: Same as on p. 627: TIOCKPT_xxx should be TIOCPKT_xxx.

- p. 697: Last sentence "16-bit UDP port number" should be "16-bit TCP
	  and UDP port numbers."

- p. 702: The following footnote should be added to the command line at the
	  top of the page: "Be aware that some systems have an rdate(8) command
	  for the superuser to set the time and date from a remote host.  If
	  you compile and run this example you may want to change the name."

- p. 716: Last paragraph of Section 18.4: "This protocol ..." should be
	  "An overview of this protocol is given in Xerox [1985]."  (There
	  is no 1986 reference by Xerox.)

- p. 723: Near center of page at right margin: "provided my" should be
	  "provided by".

- p. 751: The index entry for page 473 under "connect system call" is
	  wrong and should be removed.

- p. 753: The page numbers for the index entry for "/etc/inetd.conf file"
	  should be: 335-337, 471, 713.

	  under "rmt server" on p. 763.)

- p. 755: Delete the index entry for "inetd.conf file".  (The entry is
	  under "/etc/inetd.conf file" on p. 753.)

- p. 756: Delete the index entry for "inittab file".  (The entry is under
	  "/etc/inittab file" on p. 753.)

- p. 763: The index entry "Reynolds, J." should have an entry for p. 526.

- p. 763: The index entry "rmt server" should have an entry for p. 320.

- p. 771: Remove the index entry for T_UNBIND.

	should be "if an error occurs".

- p. 39 (Section 2.3), in the prototype for the open function, the comma
	in "oflag," should be removed.

- p. 57 (exit System Call).  The 2nd paragraph of this section should
	refer to Figure 2.1, not Figure 2.3.

- p. 58 (Section 2.5), last sentence of item 1. at bottom of page: the
	word "argv" should be italicized, not in a constant-width font.

	 capacity of a pipe" should be "If a process writes less than the
	 capacity of a pipe or FIFO".

- p. 114 (Section 3.5).  The header file "fifo.h" referred to in the
	 code on pages 113 and 114 simply contains the first 8 lines
	 from the code listing on page 112.  Add a note to the bottom
	 of p. 114 stating this.

	 should be "struct sembuf *opsptr" (remove one asterisk).

- p. 141 (Section 3.10), item 1. near top of page: "the value of sem_val is
	 added to" should be "the value of sem_op is added to".

	 should be "converts a character string".

- p. 284 (Section 6.6), the port numbers chosen for the TCP and UDP examples,
	 6000, should be different (say 6543), since 6000 is used on
	 many systems by the X11 window system.

- p. 300 (Section 6.7), halfway down the page in the code example,
	 the second argument to writev() should be "&iov[0]", not
	 "&iovec[0]".

	 it is started" should be "that inherits a socket when it is started".

- p. 323 (Section 6.11), first two entries in Figure 6.16 have incorrect
	 descriptions.  The first description (for FIOCLEX) should be
	 "set close-on-exec for fd".  The second description (for FIONCLEX)
	 should be "clear close-on-exec for fd".

- p. 333 (Section 6.15), second sentence under SIGIO: "The signal is
	 sent to the process group of the signal" should be "The signal is
	 sent to the process group of the socket".

- p. 334 (Section 6.15), second to last sentence under SIGURG: "The signal is
	 sent to the process group of the signal" should be "The signal is
	 sent to the process group of the socket".

- p. 343 (Section 7.1), first paragraph: "RFS (Remote File System)"
	 should be "RFS (Remote File Sharing)".  

- p. 350 (Section 7.4), the "char *ptr" should really be a
	 "struct t_uderr *ptr" and the call to t_alloc() should be
	 coerced as "ptr = (struct t_uderr *) t_alloc(...)"

- p. 351 (Section 7.4), final paragraph: the words "request" and "return"
	 that are in a constant-width font should both be italicized.

- p. 352 (Section 7.4), the two paragraphs following the prototype for the
	 t_connect function: the words "addr", "opt", "udata", "sequence",
	 and "len" which are all in italics should all be in a constant-width
	 font.

- p. 362 (Section 7.5), the name of the header file is not given -- it is
	 "inet.h".

- p. 362 (Section 7.5), same as p. 284 regarding the port numbers.

- p. 370 (Section 7.6), last paragraph under "nonblocking I/O": "can accept
	 some data, t_snd returns the actual number of bytes accepted and the
	 TMORE flags value is returned to the caller" should be replaced with
	 "can accept some (but not all) of the data, t_snd returns the actual
	 number of bytes accepted as if the T_MORE flags was specified by the
	 caller".

- p. 373 (Section 7.6), first sentence of "t_rcvconnect Function".
	 "allows a server to accept" should be "allows a client to initiate".

- p. 381 (Section 7.9), second to last paragraph: "Remote File System"
	 should be "Remote File Sharing".  

- p. 381 (Section 7.9), last paragraph: "/dev/sxt" should be "/dev/spx".

- p. 382 (Figure 7.19), caption: "/dev/sxt" should be "/dev/spx".

- p. 395 (Section 8.2), about half way down the page: "The addr is a
	 pointer to a sockaddr_in structure" should be "The addr is a
	 pointer to a in_addr structure".

- p. 405, 5th line from bottom, add comma after "network speed".

- p. 457, (Section 11.2), in the comment near the top of the page,
	  "convert # 16-bit words to #bytes" should be "convert #32-bit
	  words to #bytes".

- p. 458, (Section 11.2), half-way down the page the string "Source Quence"
          should be "Source Quench".

- p. 466, final sentence of first paragraph: remove "a" in "a Section 12.4.)".

	 should be "lp -dlaser1" (change -p to -d).

- p. 699 Figure 18.2: the row labelled "floating-point format": the entry
	 "IEEE" should be under "Sun RPC", not "Xerox Courier".  The entry
	 under "Xerox Courier" should be blank.

- p. 699 Figure 18.2: Under Apollo: IEEE, VAX, IBM, or Cray. (add commas)

- p. 751 (Index): the entry for "/dev/sxt" should be "/dev/spx".
