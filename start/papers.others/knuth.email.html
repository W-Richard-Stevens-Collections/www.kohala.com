Email (let's drop the hyphen)
</h1>
<p>
I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer
had an email address. I'd used email since about 1975, and it seems to
to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime.
</p>
<p>
Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top
of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things.
What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.
I try to learn certain areas of computer science exhaustively; then I try
to digest that knowledge into
a form that is accessible to people who don't have time for such study.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I need to communicate with thousands of people all over
the world as I write my books. I also want to be responsive to the people
who read those books and have questions or comments. My goal is
to do this communication efficiently, in batch mode --- like, one day every
three months. So if you want to write to me about any topic, please use
good ol' snail mail and send a letter to the following address:
</p>
<blockquote>
<address>
Prof. Donald E. Knuth<br>
Computer Science Department<br>
Gates Building 4B<br>
Stanford University<br>
Stanford, CA 94305-9045 USA.<br>
</address>
</blockquote>
<p>
I have a wonderful secretary who looks at the incoming mail and separates
out anything that she knows I've been looking forward to seeing urgently.
Everything else goes into a buffer storage area, which I empty periodically.
</p>
<p>
You might also try faxing me at 415-725-4671. But be warned that I look
at incoming fax mail
<em>last</em>, perhaps only once every six months instead of three.
</p>
<blockquote>
`I don't even have an e-mail address. I have reached an age where my main
purpose is not to receive messages.' --- Umberto Eco, quoted in the New Yorker
</blockquote>
<p>
Sometimes I do send email, through my secretary, with respect to the
project I'm currently working on, when I believe that the recipient
won't be bothered by my request. But I hope you can understand why I
am almost always unhappy to receive unsolicited email myself.
Thank you for your patience and cooperation as I try to finish
<cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite>
(<a href="http://www.kohala.com/start/papers.others/taocp.html">TAOCP</a>),
a work that I began in 1962 and that I will need many years to complete.
In return, I promise not to send unwelcome email requests to you.

<h3>
A note on email versus e-mail
</h3>
<p>
Newly coined nonce words are often spelled with a hyphen, but the
hyphen disappears when the words become widely used. For example, people
used to write ``non-zero'' and ``soft-ware'' instead of ``nonzero''
and ``software''; the same trend has occurred for hundreds of
other words. Thus it's high time for everybody to stop using the archaic
spelling ``e-mail''. Think of how many keystrokes you will save in
your lifetime if you stop now! The form ``email'' has been well
established in England for several years, so I am amazed to see
Americans being overly conservative in this regard. (Of course,
``email'' has been a familiar word in France much longer than in
England --- but for an entirely different reason.)
