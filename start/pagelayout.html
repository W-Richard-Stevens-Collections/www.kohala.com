The <I>Chicago Manual of Style</I> (14th Edition, Section 19.40) says
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Makeup is a highly skilled procedure.
If the text is merely divided mechanically into portions of equal length,
without regard to where the divisions fall,
some of the pages that result are bound to be unacceptable
logically or aesthetically: they will incorporate bad breaks."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is especially true for a programming text,
which normally contains lots of programs, figures, and tables.

<P>
This document is an attempt to describe how I perform page layout
for the books that I write, using some real examples.
These examples are from <I>UNIX Network Programming</I>
Volume 1, Second Edition (1998).

<H2><A NAME="example">The big picture: Layout of 4 pages</A></H2>

<P>
I do all my page layout by hand, chapter by chapter.
I start by running troff on a chapter and print the pages 2-up,
side by side, so that I can see what the facing pages look like.
I use the shell pipeline
<TT>make -s Chap.ioctl | ps.odd | 2up | lp</TT>
where <TT>ps.odd</TT> is a short <TT>awk</TT>
program that inserts a blank page at the beginning of standard input.

<P>
Here is an
<A HREF="troffbefore.ps">example</A>
(40 Kbytes PostScript) showing the second, third, fourth, and fifth pages
from Chapter 16.
These pages are how things "fell out" without doing anything.
<UL>

<P><LI>  The long line at the bottom is the bottom margin.
The three widest hash marks above it are at 1, 2, and 3 lines
from the bottom margin.  The three smaller hash marks in between
are at 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 lines from the bottom.
This gives me a visual indication of how far I have to go
before reaching the bottom margin.

<P><LI>  I don't show the opening page of the chapter, but the first
problem is that the heading "Section 16.2 <TT>ioctl</TT> Function"
is at the end of the opening page, with the first line of text on
the next page (428).
While the troff macros can contain a "need command",
stating that a specific amount of vertical space is required
on the current page, otherwise cause a page break,
I have removed these from the version of the <TT>-ms</TT> macros
that I use.
Occasionally I need to violate this a little,
and since I lay out each page by hand,
I put in the page breaks where I want them.

<P><LI>  The table, Figure 16.1, does not fit on p. 428, so troff
automatically does a page break to the top of p. 429.
While that is OK, it leaves almost half of page 428 blank.

<P><LI>  The program in Figure 16.2 has a page break in the middle,
which I try to avoid.

<P><LI>  The next figure, Figure 16.3 (which is not shown)
does not fit on p. 431, so a page break occurs,
but this again leaves almost half a page blank.

</UL>

<P>
Here are the
<A HREF="troffafter.ps">final pages</A>
from this example.
I have left the hash marks in at the bottom,
but naturally I delete these before the final PostScript is generated.
Here are the changes that I made in doing the layout.
Note that the page numbers have changed also.
<UL>

<P><LI>  I added <TT>.sp 4.0v</TT> between the chapter title and the
first section heading,
to move the last line of the opening page down the the bottom margin.
This also forces the heading for Section 16.2 onto a new page.
If you go through the book and measure the distance between
the chapter titles and the first section heading that follows,
most differ--it is rare to have everything just fall into place.

<P><LI>  Figure 16.1 was "floated" to the top of p. 427.
This is easy to do with troff's <TT>-ms</TT> macros:
you place a <TT>.KF</TT> before the figure,
and then add <TT>.sp 1.0v</TT> and <TT>.KE</TT> after the figure.
The reason for the spacing at the end of the float
is because the text that ends up beneath the figure on the page
may not be the text that logically follows the figure's reference.

<P><LI>  Now the text following the figure reference
("Section 16.3  Socket Operations") just gets placed onto the page.
I was able to have a nice clean page break at the bottom of p. 426
between the <TT>SIOCATMARK</TT> entry and the
<TT>SIOCPGRP</TT> entry that follows.
This did not happen by accident ...

<P><LI>  Normally there is one vertical space (12 points normally)
for the blank lines within the boxes showing the function prototypes and
function returns (i.e., the box for <TT>ioctl</TT> near the top of p. 426).
But I reduced these two to <TT>.sp 0.9v</TT> to get a little more
space on the page.

<P><LI>  The next tweak that I had to make to get some more space on p. 426
was place <TT>.sp -0.2v</TT> before the "Section 16.3" heading.
Normally there are 24 points of space between the last line of a section
and the next section heading, but I removed 2.4 points of this space
(0.2 of the normal 12-point spacing).
If I had not made this change and the previous change,
the last line of the <TT>SIOCATMARK</TT> entry would have ended up
on the next page, which is undesirable.
This takes care of p. 426.

<P><LI>  The page break between pages 427 and 428
came out OK: this natural page break was between
lines 2 and 3 of the first paragraph of Section 16.4, which is perfect,
giving 2 lines on the bottom of p. 427 and 2 lines at the top of p. 428.
But the two facing page bottoms (pp. 426 and 427) were not aligned
as close as possible.
One should always try to get the facing page bottoms at the same point
on the two pages.
That is one reason you have to look at the facing pages like this
when doing page layout (with the even page number on the left,
and the odd page number on the right).
(In <I>lingua publisha</I> it's verso and recto; I say left and right.)
To align the page bottoms I changed the <TT>.sp 1.0v</TT> that was
added earlier when Figure 16.1 was floated to <TT>.sp 1.1v</TT>.
I could have also added the extra one-tenth space before the
"Section 16.4  File Operations" heading,
but whenever I have a figure floated to the top of a page,
and I need to add space to that page,
I first add space beneath the floated figure.
That takes care of p. 427.

<P><LI>  The first change to pages 428-429 was to float Figure 16.2
to the top of p. 429, so that the program code is all on one page.
When doing a programming text I always try to keep program code
in one piece on a given page, as the top priority in the layout.

<P><LI>  But notice that three lines after the reference to Figure 16.2
is the reference to Figure 16.3, another figure that does not fit on
either p. 428 or 429.
The only thing to do here is float Figure 16.3 to the top of p. 430
(which is not shown in these sample pages).
This moves the figure two pages ahead of its reference,
which is not desirable, but there is no way around it in this situation.
What I did to compensate was add a page number reference
(second line of second paragraph of Section 16.5)
since the figure is now two pages ahead.

<P><LI>  In the third paragraph of Section 16.5 is the reference to
Figure 16.4, and it too had to float to p. 430, following Figure 16.3.
In fact, both figures completely fill p. 430,
with some extra space between the two figures,
so that the label beneath the bottom figure is at the bottom of the page.

<P><LI>  Things now got messy because following Figures 16.3 and 16.4
comes Figure 16.5, a program listing, that is referenced at the bottom
of p. 429.  I did not want the first part of the program listing on
the bottom of p. 429, and the remainder at the top of p. 431
(remember that Figures 16.3 and 16.4 occupy p. 430),
so it was time to give up with pages 428 and 429,
and just accept the fact that they could not be "filled"
all the way to the bottom.

<P><LI>  Pages 428 and 429 now need to be "finished",
given the page breaks that are caused by the figures.
Both pages are short by about 1.5 lines,
and while I could add space to get both page bottoms to the bottom margin,
I don't think this is necessary,
as long as the two page bottoms are even with each other.

<P><LI>  The first space I added (0.3v) is between the last line of code
in Figure 16.2 and the horizontal rule beneath it,
because the comment on this line of code extends way to the right,
and overlaps slightly with the filename at the end of the rule.
There are only a few of these cases in the book,
and I just fix them by hand like here.

<P><LI>  There are two blank lines in the program code in Figure 16.2
(around the definition of <TT>IFNAMSIZ</TT>)
and these are normally converted to <TT>.sp 0.7v</TT>
because a full 12-point space is too much in a program listing.
One of the first things I do when I need more space is convert these to 0.8v.

<P><LI>  The last change made to get the page bottoms even is to change
the normal 1.0v space following a floated figure beneath Figure 16.2 to 2.8v.
This aligns the page bottoms, and doing this is trial and error
(one reason I show the hash marks at the bottom of the page is to
be able to measure things like this).

</UL>

<P>
As you can see, much of this is trial and error,
and you don't just sit down and do an entire chapter in
one fell swoop.
The normal scenario goes like this.
I print the first copy of the chapter,
make the changes that I think are needed on the first few pages,
then look at the pages using something like

<P>
<TT>make -s "PAGES=-o425-435" Chap.ioctl | ps.odd | 2up | pageview -right -geometry 1100x800+0+0 -</TT>
<P>

<P>I do all my writing on a SparcStation and use Sun's <TT>pageview</TT>
program to preview PostScript on my 17-inch color monitor.
Troff's <TT>-o</TT> option lets me specify the pages for which I want it
to generate PostScript, and in this example I look at only the 11 pages
starting with page 425.

<P>
After making some changes, I rerun troff, and look at the result,
and make more changes.
As I move through a chapter, finishing pages,
I increment the starting and ending page numbers to be viewed with the
<TT>-o</TT> option.
I find that to layout <I>N</I> pages, it takes about <I>N/2</I>
troff runs.
It takes me about 3.5 minutes per final page,
so for a 1,000-page book this totals to just over 58 hours.

<P>
Is my technique ideal?  Not really, but it gives me complete
control over how my pages look,
and I think the appearance of a book is very important,
especially a programming book.
I keep thinking of writing a program to do all this for me,
but the amount of work appears enormous.
I think the approach is to have troff just generate a long stream
of PostScript, assuming an infinitely long page,
and then do the page layout on the resulting PostScript,
just moving it around on the pages.
But then I would really have to learn PostScript (ugh)
and you somehow have to generate the running headers and page numbers.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="hyphens">Hyphenation</A></H2>

<P>
The last line of a right hand page should not end with a hyphen.
This has been a style rule for many years,
yet it is amazing that most word processors do not do this!
I just smile when I pick up a book produced with something
like Frame and you immediately find these errors.
Needless to say, troff does this correctly,
and has for 20+ years.
A friend commented to me that normal evolution would have gone
Word to Frame to troff,
but instead, the computer industry has gone the other way!

<P>
Occasionally, however, hand tweaks are needed.
Page 875 originally ended at the word "out-of-band",
with "out-" on the bottom of this page and "of-band"
at the top of the next page.
(Troff allows this, since the word contains an explicit hyphen.)
To avoid this I first added backslash-p to the word before:
<TT>that\p out-of-band data</TT>.
This tells troff to end the line when it hits the backslash-p,
and the resulting line is spread out to fill the line length.

<P>
While this is OK,
I then noticed the word "by" that terminated the line above it,
and the line above was quite tight
(the interword space appeared quite minimal).
So to make these two lines even better,
and avoid the hyphen at the end of the page,
I wrote <TT>provided\p by</TT> to move "by" down one line,
producing two lines that both looked better.

<P>
Another example like this is the bottom of page 927.
I preprocess all my files through some <TT>sed</TT> scripts,
before troff sees them.
One tweak I make is to change all figure references,
such as "Figure 5.5" into <TT>Fig\%ure\~5.5</TT>.
The backslash-% is an explicit hyphenation indicator
and the backslash-tilde is gtroff's unbreakable space
that then stretches like a normal interword space
when the line is adjusted.
What I am telling troff is not to break a line with "Figure"
at the end and "5.5" at the beginning of the next line,
because I would rather have "Fig-" at the end of the line
and "ure 5.5" at the beginning of the next line.
(I learned this trick from Chapter 14 of Knuth's
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0201134470/wrichardstevensA/">
<I>The TeXBook</I></A>,
a wealth of typesetting information, even if you do not use TeX.)

<P>
The problem with this example is that page 927 then ended with "Fig-",
since the word had an explicit hyphenation indicator.
In the preceding line, the term "3 bytes" was split with "3"
at the end of the line and "bytes" at the beginning of the next line.
To fix these two line I typed <TT>first\p 3 bytes</TT>
and then <TT>in\p Figure 5.5</TT>.

<P>
Another potential hyphenation problem is when the last word
of a paragraph is hyphenated, and the part on the line by itself
is a small suffix.
Look at the sentence preceding Figure 26.11 on page 717.
Originally the last word "signal" was hyphenated,
causing "nal" to be the entire second line.
To prevent this I wrote <TT>\%signal</TT>,
which tells troff not to hyphenate the word,
forcing the end of the line before "signal" is output.
While I was able to do this on page 717,
notice that I could not do this on the fourth line from
the bottom of page 716: "happen-ing".
If I had told troff not to hyphenate this word,
the interword spacing on the line would have appeared excessive.
This is one of those decisions that you just have to make.

<P>
The <I>Chicago Manual of Style</I> (14th Edition, Section 6.58) says
that no more than three succeeding lines should be allowed to
end with hyphens.
Vanilla troff does not handle this, but gtroff does.
I specify <TT>.hlm 2</TT> so that no more than
two lines in a row can end in a hyphen.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="figs">Figure placement</A></H2>

<P>
Ideally all figures should appear sequentially and then
their text references should also be in order.
That's how I write my books.
Look at the top of page 667: the reference is to Figure 25.8,
but Figure 25.7 appears next,
even though it is not referenced until later on page 667.
Indeed, the <TT>tv_sub</TT> function on page 667 is not referenced
until line 21 of the <TT>proc_v4</TT> function on page 668.
Figure 25.8 would have fit on page 667,
but I moved it to keep it and Figure 25.9 together.
(Both of these figures would not have fit on page 667.)
I thought it was more important to keep these two figures together
(showing the two pointers into the headers along with the three lengths
on the same page as the code), than to keep the figure references in order.

<P>
Another slight violation of the rules is on page 729:
Figures 27.2 and 27.3 appear on this page,
but they are not even referenced until the next page (730).
I did this to keep these two figures along with Figure 27.1
together, on facing pages.
Since all three figures are referenced throughout this chapter,
keeping them together on facing pages just makes sense.

<P>
By default, the troff macros that I use center each picture on the page,
based on the picture's width (calculated by pic).
But there are occasions when you have multiple pictures on a page,
and you want them lined up.
Page 242, Figures 9.2 and 9.3 are one example:
I had to add an invisible box to the right of Figure 9.2
so that it aligned "correctly" with Figure 9.3.
Page 809, Figures 30.7 and 30.8 are another example.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="progs">Program code</A></H2>

<P>
An overall goal is to keep all program listings on a single page.
First, this promotes the coding style of trying to keep each
function to one page or less,
and second it is much easier to read a piece of code that you
can see as one piece.
When I have functions that exceed one page,
I break them into pieces, showing each piece as a separate figure,
hopefully on a single page.

<P>
When I first wrote Chapter 28, Figure 28.13 was in two pieces:
the first figure contained lines 1-34, and the second lines 35-55.
But when I was laying out this chapter the placement of the first figure
ended right at the bottom of the page.
I combined the two figures into one.
By getting rid of one figure, I also saved the room occupied by
the two sentences leading into the second figure,
the vertical space to that figure, the rule above the figure,
the rule below the figure, and the figure caption
(with its space above and below).
This ended up making the book two pages smaller:
notice that the chapter ends on page 782 right at the bottom
of a left hand page.
Had I retained the second figure by itself,
the chapter would have spilled over to page 783,
requiring a blank page 784,
causing Chapter 29 to start on page 785.

<P>
Sometimes it is just not possible to keep a program listing on
a single page, without adding lots of blank space to a page.
In that case I just break the listing across a page boundary,
being careful where the break occurs (with regard to C).
If the first part is on a left-hand page,
and the second part on a right-hand page,
that is great, but it does not always work out this way.
Page 324 is an example: I purposely put the page break
between the final <TT>case</TT> and the <TT>default</TT>.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="tweaks">Additional tweaks</A></H2>

<P>
Normally I do not change the vertical spacing between text lines,
but page 910 is an example of when to do this.
The page was about one-half of a vertical space too short
(the page bottom was not even with page 911),
but there is no place to add the extra space
(no headings or the like).
There are 45 lines in the option summary,
and 45/0.5v yields 0.011v,
so I added the line <TT>.vs +0.011v</TT>
to increase the line spacing for the option summary.

<P>
When I laid out the Bibliography,
the first troff run had the Bibliography end on page 969.
This means the Index will start on page 971,
giving me page 970 to "play with".
What I did was lay out each page of the Bibliography
about 2 lines "short"; that is, there is an extra space of about 2 lines
at the bottom of each page of the Bibliography.
My reason for doing this is that the most common change that I make
to the Bibliography when the book is reprinted
(when I get to correct typos and the like) is to add something,
often an URL that I have found for a paper in the Bibliography.
By giving myself some room on each page,
it makes this easier for me in the future.
I do the same thing with the Index,
because the most common change that I make to the index
with a reprint is to add, not to delete.

<P>
To align the page bottoms of the Bibliography I first go through
it and set all the page breaks, ignoring the evenness.
Then I measure how much space remains at the bottom of each page,
divide it by the number of entries on that page minus one,
and just insert that much space between each entry.
For example, page 964 needed 3.6 lines of vertical space,
and 3.6v/16 is 0.2250v, so there are 16 <TT>.sp 0.2250v</TT>
commands on that page.
