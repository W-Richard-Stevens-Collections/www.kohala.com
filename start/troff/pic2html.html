<H2>Turning PIC into HTML</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
Say you have a <TT>pic</TT> figure in a file
and you want to include the figure into an HTML document.
For example, here is the file <TT>pic.ms</TT>:
<LISTING>
    .EQ
    delim $$
    .EN
    .PS
        arrow
        box "$space 0 {H( omega )} over {1 - H( omega )}$"
        arrow
    .PE
</LISTING>
We can generate PostScript using <TT>groff</TT>,
and then use <TT>ghostscript</TT> to generate a GIF image,
but we get a full-sized 8.5 by 11-inch page for the GIF image
(or whatever size page you use with <TT>groff</TT>).
We want just the figure.
<P>
I run the following steps on a BSD/OS 3.0 system,
as it provides all the programs with a full system installation.
First generate PostScript using <TT>groff</TT>, as in
<LISTING>
    groff -e -p -ms pic.ms > file1.ps
</LISTING>
Then use <TT>ghostscript</TT> to generate the full 8.5 by 11-inch
GIF image.
<LISTING>
    gs -q -sDEVICE=gifmono -sOutputFile=file1.gif -r150x150 file1.ps < /dev/null
</LISTING>
You can change the resolution as desired,
depending on the amount of text in the figure, its size,
and how big you want the result.
For this example, with a resolution of 150 by 150,
the resulting GIF image was 1280 by 1650.
<P>
We now need the PostScript bounding box of just the figure.
<LISTING>
    giftopnm file1.gif | pbmtoepsi -bbonly
</LISTING>
The first program converts a GIF file into a portable anymap,
and the second converts a portable bitmap into Encapsulated PostScript.
This generates the following two lines of output:
<LISTING>
    %!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2
    %%BoundingBox: 150 1401 412 1475
</LISTING>
The four numbers on the second line
are based on the PostScript coordinate system,
which has (0,0) at the lower left,
but in the next pipeline the <TT>pnmcut</TT> program
assumes that (0,0) is the upper left.
If the four numbers printed as the bounding box are
<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>, and <I>d</I>,
then the four arguments to <TT>pnmcut</TT> are
<I>a</I>, <I>-d</I>, <I>(c-a+1)</I>, and <I>(d-b+1)</I>.
<LISTING>
    giftopnm file1.gif | pnmcut 150 -1475 263 75 | ppmtogif > file2.gif
</LISTING>
The size of the final file <TT>file2.gif</TT> is now 263 by 75.
<P>
Here is the final figure:
<IMG SRC="file2.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">

<HR>
Naturally, there is another (easier) way to do this.
My thanks to Scott Schwartz (&lt;schwartz@bio.cse.psu.edu&gt;)
for telling me about the following.
This technique uses the <TT>pnmcrop</TT> program,
which accomplishes the same effect as using the PostScript bounding box:
<LISTING>
gs -q -sDEVICE='ppmraw' -sOutputFile='-' -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE file1.ps | pnmcrop | ppmtogif > file2.gif
</LISTING>
Beware that <TT>pnmcrop</TT> can use a lot of memory,
so you may need to increase the amount of data space for your programs
(the KornShell <TT>ulimit</TT> command; <TT>limit</TT> for the C Shell).
I execute <TT>ulimit -d 65535</TT> in the KornShell to increase
the datasize to 64 Mbytes.
