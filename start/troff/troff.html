<P>
This page contains numerous resources for people using troff.
My thanks to the Computing Sciences Research Group at Bell Labs
for making PostScript copies of so many of their reports available.
<P>
Note that the raw troff input for the
<A HREF="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/index.html">document set</A>
that came with the Seventh Edition release Unix
(aka Unix Version 7, dated 1979) is now available.
Thanks again to Bell Labs for making this available.

<LI><A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/groff-1.11a.tar.gz">Groff</A>.
    This is the GNU troff package (groff), written by
    <A HREF="http://www.jclark.com/">James J. Clark</A>.
    It includes implementations of troff, eqn, pic, refer, and tbl.
    The current version is 1.11a.

    <P>Can you imagine anyone rewriting troff from scratch,
    in what ended up as about 60,000 lines of C++?
    Wow, I <I>am</I> impressed.
    If it were not for James' freely available reimplementation,
    troff would be dead by now.

    <I>Troff User's Manual</I></A>
    by Jospeh F. Ossanna and Brian W. Kernighan,
    revised November 1992.
    This is the definitive guide to all troff commands.
    GNU's gtroff adds numerous capabilities to troff
    and these enhancements are described in the gtroff man page.

    <I>A Typesetter-independent TROFF</I></A>
    by Brian W. Kernighan,
    revised March 1992.
    This describes the changes made to troff to make it
    typesetter independent.
    The details are only of interest to people writing troff postprocessors
    for new devices, but the historical details are interesting.

    GNU's gpic adds numerous capabilities to pic (alignment of text
    with arrows, and the like) and these enhancements are described
    in the gpic man page.
