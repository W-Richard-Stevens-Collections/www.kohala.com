The following errors are corrected in the Fifth Printing and later (check the
last line on the copyright page to determine the printing).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

p.  22:	2nd line of indented paragraph: the URL for Netperf is now
	http://www.netperf.org/netperf/NetperfPage.html.

The following errors are corrected in the Fourth Printing and later (check the
last line on the copyright page to determine the printing).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

p. 210:	In the example output towards the bottom of the page, the line
	"xpath xpath MessageID" should be "xpath MessageID".

p. 213:	6th line from top: the final article number in the .newsrc file
	should be 43814, not 43815 (because 43815 is the first unread
	article in the example at the bottom of the page).

The following errors are corrected in the Third Printing and later (check the
last line on the copyright page to determine the printing).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

p.  26:	4th line of 2nd paragraph: "Some of the work related to the routing
	table" should be "All of the work related to the routing table".

p.  34:	4th last line of page: "Figure 2.5, instead noting" should be
	"Figure 2.6, instead noting".

p.  74:	3rd line from bottom: "Figure 6.1" should be "Figure 6.2".

p. 188:	The indented paragraph at the top of the page: "As described in
	Volume 2, ...".  Add the following sentence to the end of this
	paragraph: "This fudge factor is applied only by Berkeley-derived
	implementations (pp. 257-258 of Volume 1)."

p. 200:	2nd paragraph from the bottom: "used for the TAO cache."  This should
	be "used for the TAO cache, although 256 bytes are actually allocated,
	given the BSD memory allocation policy."  The value "168,000" in the
	next sentence should then be "256,000".

p. 224:	1st line of 3rd paragraph of Section 16.4: "AF_UNIX" should be
	"PF_UNIX".

The following errors are corrected in the Second Printing and later (check the
last line on the copyright page to determine the printing).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

p.   4:	Code line 12: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p.   6:	Code line 10: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p.  10:	Code line 12: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p.  11:	Code line 10: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p.  17:	Code line 12: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p.  18:	Code line 10: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p.  36:	Second bullet on the page, the string ".ix RFC~1122" should be deleted.

p.  95: The indented paragraph at the top of this page ("The original T/TCP
	source code ...") should be removed.  See the 12 Jan 96 bug fix on
	the author's T/TCP home page for a detailed analysis of why the
	TF_ACKNOW flag must be set when the retransmission timer expires.
	The source code fix is to add the line
                tp->t_flags |= TF_ACKNOW;
	between source code lines 171 and 172 on page 842 of Volume 2.

p. 223:	2nd line from the top: "hostname:display:screen" should have a period
	between "display" and "screen", not a colon: "hostname:display.screen".

p. 225:	Code line 13: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p. 226:	Code line 12: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p. 305:	Code line 10: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p. 307:	Code line 12: the 2nd and 3rd arguments to memset() are swapped.

p. 316:	Index entry for Braden, R. T.: delete "-95".

p. 321:	Index entry for Net/3: delete entry for page 95.

p. 322: Index entry for retransmission timer: delete entry for page 95.

p. 323:	Index entry for RFC 1122: add page 36 to this entry.

p. 326:	Index entry for tcp_output function: delete entry for page 95.

p. 326:	Index entry for tcp_timers function: delete entire entry.

p. 326: Index entry for TCPT_REXMT constant: delete entire entry.

p. 326: Index entry for TF_ACKNOW constant: delete entry for page 95.

The following are Comments to the Reader, they are not typos to be fixed.

p.  99:	A source code fix is required between lines 133 and 134 of Figure
	9.2.  See the 11 Jan 96 bug fix on the author's T/TCP home page for
	the actual code fix.

p. 132:	A source code fix is required to correct line 607.  See the 30 Jan 96
	bug fix on the author's T/TCP home page for the fix and a detailed
	analysis.

p. 144:	Some new code is required between lines 1180-1181.  See the 30 Jan 96
	bug fix on the author's T/TCP home page for the fix and a detailed
	analysis.

- The following comments from Garrett A. Wollman describe the movitation
  behind the per-host cache maintained by T/TCP:

    Chapter 6 is missing some of discussion on the motivating need behind
    the development of this code.  It was not done originally to support
    Transaction TCP; that only came later, after my supervisor and I hit
    upon the idea that the work I had done in creating the per-host cache
    for regular TCP was just what Transaction TCP needed.  The original
    work was motivated by the desire to do Path MTU discovery (finally
    implemented a year later), and to have the TCP statistics in the route
    metrics perform some useful function.  (In their original Net/2 form,
    you will recall, TCP statistics would never get saved on machines
    using only a default route.)  My initial work in this area actually
    began in 1993, before I came to work at MIT.  Some contact with Ran
    Atkinson's group at NRL suggested that this work would be helpful for
    their IPv6 implementation, as well.

- Readers interested in implementing T/TCP should also be aware that some
  bugs have been fixed to allow the code in Chapter 6 to manage cache
  entries in the presence of dynamic routing.  The problems occur when
  the route to a host changes or is deleted before its cache entry expires.
  These fixes apply to the files in_rmx.c (shown in Volume 3) along with
  route.c and radix.c.  Current FreeBSD releases contain the fixes.
