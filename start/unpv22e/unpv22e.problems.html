Reported problems building the source code

<BODY>

<P>
The following problems have been reported by readers building the
source code.
I am just collecting these and making them available:
I do not have access to all the systems to try and duplicate
the problems and/or fix them.
Please let me know of any additional problems.

<UL>

<P>
<LI>Digital Unix 4.0:
	The <TT>configure</TT> script does not find the <TT>sigwait</TT>
	function.  The easiest solution is to uncomment the <TT>#undef</TT>
	of <TT>HAVE_SIGWAIT</TT> in <TT>config.h</TT> and change the
	<TT>#undef</TT> to <TT>#define</TT>.

<P>
<LI>HP-UX 10.x/GCC:
	Run <TT>./configure</TT> as instructed in the <TT>README</TT> file.

	<P>
	Edit the file <TT>unpv22e/lib/unpipc.h</TT> and insert
	<TT>#ifdef HAVE_PTHREAD_H</TT>
	just before the Pthread_xxxx prototypes,
	(which start on line 427), and put a <TT>#endif</TT> just after
	the prototype for <TT>pr_thread_id</TT>.  (New line 459.)

	<P>
	Edit the file <TT>unpv22e/lib/my_shm.c</TT> and change both 
	occurrences of <TT>MAP_ANON</TT> to <TT>MAP_ANONYMOUS</TT>.

	<P>
	Optional: If you have superuser privileges, 
	clean up the include header <TT>/usr/include/rpc/xdr.h</TT>:
	Remove the extra <TT>/*</TT> inside the commented-out 
	<TT>#endif</TT> on line 26--this will stop a plethora of 
	(harmless) compiler warnings about the embedded 
	comment start token.

	<P>
	cd to <TT>unpv22e/lib</TT> and do a <TT>make</TT>.

	<P>
	Continue on as described in the <TT>README</TT> file.

<P>
<LI>AIX 4.3.1:
	There are three compiler warnings when compiling the file
	<tt>/lib/wrapsunrpc.c</tt>.  These are because the AIX headers
	do not use the <tt>const</tt> qualifier for the first and last
	arguments to <tt>clnt_create</tt>.

	<P>Beware of the following comment in the system headers
	<tt>&lt;mqueue.h&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;semaphore.h&gt;</tt>:
	<PRE>
	/* THIS FILE is for conformance to IEEE POSIX 1003.1c.
	 * It describes required symbols for the Realtime option
	 * which is NOT SUPPORTED.
	 */
	</PRE>
	AIX 4.3.1 does conform to Unix 98, but the Posix realtime options
	are (unfortunately) an option to Unix 98.

<P>
<LI>Linux:
	The standard Linux releases do not support the Posix.1b APIs
	(Posix message queues, Posix semaphores, and Posix shared memory).
	I just just been made aware of a
	<A HREF="http://www.ispras.ru/~knizhnik/">Posix.1b library</A>
	for Linux.

<P>
<LI>Linux, RedHat 5.1:
	The function prototype for <tt>semctl</tt> in
	<tt>&lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</tt> is wrong: the fourth argument is optional
	(depending on the command) and should be specified as <tt>...</tt>
	(an ellipsis).
	This causes an error when compiling the library.  The easiest fix
	is to add a dummy argument of 0 to the call to <tt>semctl</tt>
	that contains just three arguments in <tt>lib/wrapunix.c</tt>.

	<P>This system also has a <tt>&lt;semaphore.h&gt;</tt> header,
	but it doesn't appear to fully support Posix semaphores (it appears
	to support only Posix memory-based semaphores).  To prevent trying
	to use Posix semaphores, comment out the definition of
	<tt>HAVE_SEMAPHORE_H</tt> in the <tt>config.h</tt> header.

<P>
<LI>Solaris 2.6:
	All my Solaris work was done with GCC, not the Sun C compiler.
	(Anyone at Sun is welcome to send me the Sun compiler.)
	The <tt>CFLAGS</tt> variable set by the <tt>configure</tt> script
	almost certainly needs to be changed for the Sun compiler.
