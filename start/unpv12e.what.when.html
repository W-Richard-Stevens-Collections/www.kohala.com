<H2>What is in it, and when will it be available?</H2>
<P>
When I started the second edition in 1996 I just started with the
Sockets chapter, seeing how big it got.
I had originally planned to include IPC
(Chapter 3 in the 1990 edition) and applications
(the last half of the 1990 edition) but they just don't fit.

<P>
The second edition of <I>UNIX Network Programming</I>
will therefore appear in multiple volumes.
<UL>
<LI>Volume 1, subtitled <I>Networking APIs: Sockets and XTI</I>,
    was available in October 1997.
    <P>
    This volume alone is about 70% bigger than the entire 1990 edition
    (290,000 words versus 170,000).
    <P>
    The Preface (go back with your browser) contains a detailed listing
    of what has changed since the 1990 edition, and what new topics
    are covered.
<P>
<LI>Volume 2, subtitled
    <A HREF="unpv22e/unpv22e.html">
    <I>IPC: Interprocess Communication</I></A>,
    was available in August 1998.
    <P>
    This volume is an update of Chapter 3 from the 1990 edition,
    along with the newer Posix 1003.1b-1993 realtime IPC
    (what used to be called Posix.4),
    Sun RPC, and the new Solaris doors API.
    Check the
    <A HREF="unpv22e/unpv22e.html">
    Preface</A> for a detailed listing
    of what has changed since the 1990 edition, and what new topics
    are covered.
    <P>
    This volume is about 140,000 words so the combined Volumes 1 and 2
    are about 2.5 times the size of the 1990 edition.
<P>
<LI>Volume 3, subtitled <I>Applications</I>,
    will be an update of the final half of the 1990 edition,
    probably with some new applications.
    Note that a few applications snuck into Volume 1:
    ping, traceroute, and inetd.
    <P>
    I have not yet started this volume, and have no estimated completion date.
</UL>

<P>The 1990 edition will remain in print until Volume 3 is published.
