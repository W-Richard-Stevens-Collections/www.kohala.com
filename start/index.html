Some of the following are papers that I have referenced in my books,
often Usenet postings, that are not easily obtainable.
Others are just papers that I think are interesting.
Enjoy--most are classics.

<LI>Borman, D. A. 1997,
    "<A HREF="borman.97jan30.txt">
     Re: Frequency of RST terminated connections</A>,"
    end2end-interest Mailing List,
    Jan. 30, 1997.
    A note that the upper limit of port 5000 for the ephemeral port numbers
    was a typo that occurred around 1986 right before 4.3BSD was released.
    The upper limit was meant to be 50,000.

<LI>Borman, D. A. 1997,
    "<A HREF="borman.97jun06.txt">
     Re: SYN/RST cookies</A>,"
    tcp-impl Mailing List,
    June 6, 1997.
    A note that the concept of the listen() backlog is a limit on the
    number of established connections.  The purpose of this limit is
    to prevent TCP from accepting new connection requests when the
    application is not accept()ing them.

<P>
<LI>Braden, R. T. 1993,
    "<A HREF="tcplw-extensions.txt">
     TCP Extensions for High Performance: An Update</A>,"
    Internet Draft,
    June 21, 1993.
    Unfortunately this Internet Draft expired quite a while ago and was
    never published as an RFC.  Nevertheless, the ideas in the draft appear
    in all current implementations of RFC 1323.

<P>
<LI>I have always been a fan of Richard W. Hamming.
    I did not keep very many of the textbooks that I acquired in
    graduate school, but kept all four of his books
    (along with all my Knuth, Kernighan, and Kleinrock books).
    Here is a wonderful <A HREF="papers.others/hammingbio.ps">biography
    and obituary</A> of Hamming (6 pages of PostScript),
    which includes a nice summary of his major accomplishments.
    <A HREF="gifs/hamming.html">Here</A> are the three photos
    that go with the biography.

    <P>I will never forget having learned about digital filters from
    the classic Digital Signal Processing books of the 1970s
    (Oppenheim and Schafer, etc.) and then finding Hamming's
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=048665088X/wrichardstevensA/">
    Digital Filters</A> book, and wondering why all the classic texts
    made the topic so hard to understand when Hamming could make it
    so easy to understand.
    Some readers have told me that they find that my books
    make a complicated subject (such as network programming)
    easy to understand--if that is true,
    then it is due to the influence of writers like Richard Hamming
    and Brian Kernighan.

    Message-ID: &lt;79m7m4$reh$1@dog.ee.lbl.gov&gt;,
    Feb. 8, 1999.
    People have wondered why traceroute uses UDP probes instead of
    ICMP echo probes (which apparently Microsoft traceroute uses).
    Here is the answer from the original author.

<P>
<LI>Readers (and copy editors) are occasionally surprised
    by my use of compound words, instead of using either the
    open or hyphenated form.
    That is, I write <I>filesystem</I> instead of either

    about why we should write <I>email</I> instead of <I>e-mail</I>

<H2><A NAME="bio">Biography</A></H2>

I received the B.S.E. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of
Michigan (1973), and the M.S. (1978) and Ph.D. (1982) in Systems
Engineering (image processing major, physiology minor)
from the University of Arizona.

<P>
I have had many lives as a programmer.
After getting my B.S.E. I spent 2 years writing operating systems in
assembler, 7 years in the astronomy world (at Kitt Peak National Observatory
in Tucson, doing real-time data acquisition and image processing), then
8 years as Vice President of a health-care software startup in Connecticut
(Health Systems International).
Since 1990 I have been self-employed, living in Tucson, writing
books full-time with occasional teaching of classes based on the books.
<P>
In what seems to be a previous life (1970s) I was a flight instructor,
although most of my flying these days is in the back of a commercial airliner
or down the steeps at Taos Ski Valley.
I am willing to admit that my first programming language was Fortran,
that I once programmed in Forth and Cobol,
and that I still have (from my undergraduate years)
both my IBM green card and my slide rule
(which Kelly Johnson calls a "Michigan calculator").

<P>
Here is a <A HREF="bio1.html">longer biography</A>,
mainly about how I got into computers and Unix.

<P>
Here is a chronological list of the various
<A HREF="bio3.html">computer systems and programming languages</A>
that I have used.

<H2>Where are you from?</H2>

<P>
Chronologically and geographically I have lived lots of places.
When someone asks me "where are you from?" or "where did you grow up?"
my reply begins with "it's a long story".

<LI>1951: I was born in Luanshya, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia).
My father (an American, although he had spent much of his youth
in Southern Africa and Tasmania) was working at the
Roan Antelope Copper Mine,
where he had worked as a metallurgical engineer
since graduating from Columbia University in 1937.
My mother (also an American) had gone to Northern Rhodesia to visit
her brother (another mining engineer from Columbia),
met my father, got married, and stayed 16 years longer than planned.
<P>
<LI>1956-1960: Salt Lake City, Utah.
My father was working for Kennecott Copper Corp. (Bingham Canyon).
<P>
<LI>1960-1964: Hurley, New Mexico.
My father was working for Kennecott Copper Corp. (Chino Mines).
<P>
<LI>1964: Washington, D.C.
My father was at the Brookings Institution for 6 months.
<P>
<LI>1964-1971: Phalaborwa, South Africa.
My parents went to South Africa for the development and opening
of the new Palabora Copper Mine in the northeastern Transvaal.
(Phalaborwa is one of the gates into the Kruger Game Reserve.)
<P>
<LI>1964-1968: Waynesboro, Virginia.
When my parents moved to South Africa I was about to start high school,
and had my choice of a boarding school in the U.S. or an
English-style boarding school in South Africa.
I chose the former and attended Fishburne Military School for 4 years,
going "home" to South Africa each summer.
<P>
<LI>1968-1973: Ann Arbor, Michigan,
attending the University of Michigan.
<P>
<LI>1969: Sallisaw, Oklahoma.  I had a summer job with Bechtel Corp.
at the construction of the Kerr McGee uranium treatment plant in Gore, OK.
<P>
<LI>1971, 1972: Carrollton, Georgia.
I had summer jobs with the Southwire Corp.,
the first summer as a computer operator,
and the second summer as a programmer.
<P>
<LI>1973-1975: Santa Ana, California.
After graduating from Michigan,
I worked for 2 years at Singer's M & M Computer Division
as a programmer.
<P>
<LI>1975-1982: Tucson, Arizona.
I worked full-time for Kitt Peak Observatory
and attended graduate school at the University of Arizona.
Yes, it is possible to obtain a Ph.D. while working full-time,
although you don't have much free time.
<P>
<LI>1982-1990: New Haven, Connecticut.
I worked for Health Systems International.
<P>
<LI>1990-present: Tucson, Arizona.
