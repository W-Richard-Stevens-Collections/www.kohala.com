<BODY>

<P>
The following problems have been reported by readers building the
source code.
I am just collecting these and making them available:
I do not have access to all the systems to try and duplicate
the problems and/or fix them.
Please let me know of any additional problems.

<UL>

<P>
<LI>FreeBSD 2.2.5.
	The <TT>configure</TT> script does not detect the <TT>timespec</TT>
	structure that is defined in <TT>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</TT>.
	The fix is to add <TT>#define HAVE_TIMESPEC_STRUCT 1</TT>
	to <TT>config.h</TT>.

	<P>
	An alternate fix is to change the <TT>configure</TT> script,
	as noted here:

<PRE>
echo $ac_n "checking for timespec{}""... $ac_c" 1&gt;&6
echo "configure:3077: checking for timespec{}" &gt;&5
if eval "test \"`echo '$''{'ac_cv_have_timespec_struct'+set}'`\" = set";
then
  echo $ac_n "(cached) $ac_c" 1&gt;&6
else
  cat &gt; conftest.$ac_ext &lt;&lt;EOF
#line 3082 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;   /* &lt;== added for FreeBSD 2.2.5 */
EOF
if (eval "$ac_cpp conftest.$ac_ext") 2&gt;&5 |
  egrep "timespec" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1; then
  rm -rf conftest*
  ac_cv_have_timespec_struct=yes
else
  rm -rf conftest*
  ac_cv_have_timespec_struct=no
fi
rm -f conftest*
 
fi
 
echo "$ac_t""$ac_cv_have_timespec_struct" 1&gt;&6
if test $ac_cv_have_timespec_struct = yes ; then 
        cat &gt;&gt; confdefs.h &lt;&lt;\EOF
#define HAVE_TIMESPEC_STRUCT 1
EOF
  
fi

<P>
<LI>HP-UX 10.10 and 10.20 (PA-RISC):
	One reader reports the following changes:<BR>

	I modified the <TT>Make.defines</TT> file
	created by <TT>configure</TT>:
<PRE>
# System = hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.2
                              
CC = cc                       
# I added -Aa flag (Ansi Mode Compilation) in CFLAGS variable
CFLAGS = -g -D_HPUX_SOURCE -Aa
LIBS = ../libunp.a                         
LIBS_XTI = ../libunpxti.a ../libunp.a -lxti
</PRE>

	To build <TT>libgai</TT> I had problems with the
	<TT>h_errno</TT> variable undefined,
	so I found the definition of this variable in
	<TT>/usr/include/netdb.h</TT>,
	the code fragment in <TT>netdb.h</TT> is:
<PRE>
#ifdef _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED                                 
extern int h_errno;                                           
#endif                                                        
</PRE>
	So I just added the <TT>-D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</TT>
	directive in <TT>CFLAGS</TT> in <TT>Make.defines</TT>
	but this didn't work so I did a dirty modification to the
	<TT>libgai/addrinfo.h</TT> file,
	I included the next line at the begining of <TT>addrinfo.h</TT> file:
<PRE>
extern int h_errno;
</PRE>

<P>
<LI>HP-UX B10.20 (9000/700 series):
	Another reader reports that defining <TT>_HPUX_SOURCE</TT>
	fixes numerous problems.


<P>
<LI>Linux, RedHat 5.0:
	Readers have reported problems compiling the code in the
	<TT>libgai/</TT> directory: the <TT>NI_</TT> constants
	referenced in the file <TT>gn_ipv46.c</TT> are undefined.
	The easiest solution is to take the definitions of the
	<TT>NI_</TT> constants from the <TT>addrinfo.h</TT> header
	and put them into the <TT>gai_hdr.h</TT> header.

<P>
<LI>Linux systems with glibc2.0.6:
	One reader has reported that Figure 16.7 (line 22) encounters a
	problem on these systems.  Apparently <TT>ioctl</TT> returns
	a value of 0 for <TT>ifc_len</TT> if it encounters an error,
	instead of <TT>ioctl</TT> returning -1.
	The easiest solution is to change line 12 to initialize
	<TT>lastlen</TT> to -1.

<P>	Another problem has been reported with glibc2: the <TT>configure</TT>
	script assumes that the presence of the <TT>addrinfo</TT> structure
	in <TT>&lt;netdb.h&gt;</TT> means that the <TT>NI_xxx</TT> names are
	defined in that header, which is not the case for these systems.
	You will need to define these constants yourself.

<P>
<LI>Linux systems with kernel 2.0.33:
	The header <TT>poll.h</TT> is apparently in the
	<TT>/usr/include/sys</TT> directory and not the expected
	<TT>/usr/include</TT> directory for <TT>#include &lt;poll.h&gt;</TT>
	that appears in the <TT>configure</TT> script and other headers.
	The easiest fix is to just make a link.

<P>
<LI>Linux, Slackware 3.3.
	Building the library in <TT>/lib</TT> generates a compiler
	error for line 102 of the file <TT>wrapsock.c</TT>
	complaining that the functions prototype for the <TT>Poll</TT>
	wrapper function is wrong.
	Installing the <TT>pthreads-1.0.tar.gz</TT> package solves
	the problem.

<P>
<LI>NeXTStep 3.3 on an Intel/NeXT platform:
	The following two fixes are needed.
	(1) Add <TT>-posix</TT> to the <TT>CC</TT> flag in the
	<TT>Make.defines</TT> file.
	(2) The function <TT>strdup</TT> is not provided by the standard C
	library so you must provide your own, add it to the <TT>lib</TT>
	directory and add <TT>strdup.o</TT> to <TT>LIB_OBJS</TT> in the
	<TT>Make.defines</TT> file.

<P>
<LI>Reliant Unix (used to be called SINIX).
	Add the following three lines to the <TT>config.guess</TT> file:
<PRE>
RM*:ReliantUNIX-*:*:*) 
echo mips-sni-sysv4 
exit 0 ;; 
</PRE>
	They should be located near the SINIX section and
	the SINIX section should stay in place,
	as many older systems are still around. 

<P>
<LI>SGI IRIX 6.3.
	I have received the following comments regarding the system
	identified by the <TT>configure</TT> script as
	<TT>mpis-sgi-irix6.3</TT> on an SGI O2:

<P>
The <TT>configure</TT> script seems to work OK, but it does enable the
<TT>HAVE_MSGHDR_MSG_CONTROL</TT> constant in <TT>config.h</TT>.
This causes the code in <TT>lib/read_fd.c</TT> to fail
on line 34 of page 387 in UNP.
The constant <TT>SCM_RIGHTS</TT> on that line is not known on the SGI
apparently.  I removed the define in <TT>config.h</TT> and the code
compiles OK.

<P>
The <TT>config.h</TT> file correctly attempts to substitute <TT>socklen_t</TT>
with <TT>unsigned int</TT>, but for some reason the compilation in <TT>lib</TT>
doesn't actually do the substitution properly, this is probably an
SGI idiosyncrasy, I have seen many others.
I think SGI is probably behind in their implementation of Posix.1g.
The code compiles with warning messages.

<P>
The strangest error is that SGI haven't prototyped the <TT>pthread_create</TT>
function properly.
In their code and man page, the second argument is prototyped as
<TT>pthread_attr_t *</TT>, i.e. without the <TT>const</TT> modifier.
I have been chasing around all morning to see if I have missed
something on this.
I have the latest patch installed, but no dice.
I have opened a case with tech support, and will let you know what happens.

<P>
Compiling in <TT>intro/</TT> generates many warning errors saying that
the weak definitions of <TT>xdr_*</TT> functions in
<TT>/usr/lib/libnsl.so</TT> are preempted by weak definitions in
<TT>/usr/lib/libc.so</TT>.
So now we know!

<P>
<LI>Solaris 2.6 (and probably other versions, when using Sun's C compiler).
	Although I had early access to Solaris 2.6 for testing,
	this did not include Sun's C compiler, so I had to use <TT>gcc</TT>.
	If <TT>gcc</TT> is not being used, the <TT>configure</TT> script
	defines <TT>__STDC__</TT> which is probably not correct.
