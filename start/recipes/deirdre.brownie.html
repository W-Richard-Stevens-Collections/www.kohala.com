<H1>Deirdre's Chocolate Lovers Brownies</H1>

A good friend of mine sent this recipe to me with the note:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have tried dozens of brownie recipes over the years and I finally got
one that has the right flavor and the right consistency.  Many thanks to
Deirdre Christman for this fool-proof (it worked for me!) and easy one..

Whenever I need to bake something in a hurry I always make these brownies,
because they are so easy and so good.

<UL>

<LI>  2 sticks of unsalted butter
<LI>  4 squares of unsweetened chocolate
<LI>  2 cups sugar (you may like a tad less)
<LI>  4 eggs (if they are jumbo use only 3)
<LI>  1 cup flour
<LI>  pinch salt
<LI>  &frac12 teaspoon vanilla
<LI>  1 cup chocolate chips
<LI>  1 cup walnuts (optional)

</UL>

<P>
Melt butter and chocolate slowly in a pot large enough to hold all of
the ingredients.  Cool slightly then add sugar and then beat in one egg
at a time.  Then add vanilla and all of the rest of the ingredients,
mixing enough just to blend the flour.
(Sometimes I replace the chocolate chips
with either peanut butter chips, raspberry chips, or mint chips.
The latter two I often find in the grocery store around Christmas.)

<P>
Spread evenly into a greased 9 by 13 pan
and bake in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 25 minutes.

<P>
Cool several hours before trying to cut or remove from pan.
