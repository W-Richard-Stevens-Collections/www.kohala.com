<H2>W. Richard Stevens' Favorite Recipes</H2>

<P>
And you thought I only wrote computer books?
During the 1980s, while working at HSI in Connecticut,
I did a lot of baking on the weekends,
probably as a stress reliever from working at a startup,
and also because I am a confirmed chocoholic.
On Monday morning I would always take in to work what was left over,
often finding people waiting in the coffee room for me.
Here are my favorite recipes.
