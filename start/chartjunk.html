<H2>Chartjunk</H2>

<P>
In my opinion there has been a tendency over the past years
to add fluff to the figures in books, just for fluff's sake.
This has been driven by the simplicity of generating these figures
with easy-to-use computer programs.
<A HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/faculty/tufte.html">Edward
R. Tufte</A> has written three wonderful books on
the presentation and interpretation of graphical information:

<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=096139210X/wrichardstevensA/">
<I>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</I></A>,

<I>Envisioning Information</I></A>, and

<I>Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative</I></A>.
</UL>

Chapter 5 of the first book is titled "Chartjunk" and notes the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The interior decoration of graphics generates a lot of ink
that does not tell the viewer anything new.
The purpose of decoration varies--to make the graphic appear
more scientific and precise, to enliven the display,
to give the designer an opportunity to exercise artistic skills.
Regardless of its cause, it is all non-data-ink
or redundant data-ink, and it is often chartjunk."

My pet peeve is the artificial shading that is added to figures,
tying to add dimension, as in the following:

Personally I'll take the second design over the first.
I think the names stand out more in the second design,
whereas the shading in the first design detracts from the names.

<P>
Just as the easy-to-use graphics programs led to chartjunk with the
normal black/white/gray figures in current books, I think we will see
<I>colorjunk</I> as books move to CDs (basically anything in HTML format)
as authors get to play with color,
something they don't normally get to do with a book.
