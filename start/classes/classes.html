<H2>Classes taught by W. Richard Stevens</H2>

<P>
(Currently I have no public classes scheduled.)

<P>
I teach very few classes these days (no more than 10 days a year),
preferring to focus my energies on writing,
and having burned out from too much travel (64 teaching days in 1995).
Nevertheless, I do take on new clients if things look right.
My main desire is highly motivated students.
Two things I avoid are frigid climates during the winter
(with a possible exception if good skiing is nearby)
and propeller-driven commuter airline access
(I used to be a flight instructor; I know better).
You should be aware that my fees are higher than most instructors:
contact me through private email if you are seriously interested.

<P>
