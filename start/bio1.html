<P>
My first encounter with computers was in 1968 as a Freshman engineering
student at the University of Michigan, taking a required Fortran IV
class.  Although I was an Aerospace Engineering major, this class made
me realize that I enjoyed my programming class more than my other classes.
I kept taking all the programming classes that I could as electives, and
one of the really neat things about the U. of M. was that I could take
all the computer classes that I wanted (undergrad or graduate), as long
as I had the background.  In my second programming class we got to write
PDP-8 machine code (not assembler), running our programs on a PDP-8
simulator that ran on an IBM 360.  My next programming class (CCS 473),
was taught by Bernard Galler and covered IBM assembler and Snobol 4.
Next was CCS 573, taught by Larry Flanigan, and we got to write an
operating system for an IBM mainframe in assembler, and run it on
its own virtual machine on the 360/67.

<P>
I had two jobs while an undergraduate: I was a programmer for the
Astronomy Department, programming a PDP-8 at their McMath-Hulbert
Observatory near Pontiac, Michigan, and I was a counselor at the
Computer Center.  The latter was one of the more prestigious jobs on
campus, paying as I recall around $4/hour in 1973.  One had to take a
test to get the job, and not too many undergrads passed the test.  We
were then the answer people at the Computing Center for anyone using
MTS (the Michigan Terminal System).  One of the fun projects that I
did for the Astronomy Department was writing a program that ran on
both the IBM mainframe (for the actual computing) and a PDP-9 (an
18-bit system) that did all the interactive display and input.  The
PDP-9 operating system was written by
<A HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~blinn/">
Jim Blinn</A>,
who went on to become famous in the graphics field.

<P>
After graduating in 1973 I went into the programming field.  It was not
a good time for Aerospace Engineers (Boeing was laying off thousands of
them) and I found programming more fun anyways.  I drove across country
in my yellow 1970 VW bug (which I drove until 1986) to Los Angeles,
having had enough cold weather in 5 years in Ann Arbor, and found a job
within a few days.  I worked for the M & M Computer Division of Singer
Corp. in the city of Orange.  (Yes, the sewing machine people.  Every
company was trying the computer field back then.  M & M stood for "Murphy
and McKee", the two founders who sold the company to Singer around 1973.)
We made RJE stations (Remote Job Entry), which was a fancy name for a
minicomputer with a card reader, teletype, and line printer, that
connected to a mainframe across a network.  Lots of companies couldn't
afford their own computers so they used an RJE station to send jobs to
someone else's mainframe.  We used Data General minicomputers and wrote
the operating system (in assembler, of course) that handled all the devices,
including the network communications (9600 baud synchronous was fast then).
Standard memory was 4096 16-bit words.  As I recall the typical system
required about 3 boxes of punched cards (2,000 per box?).  Dropping the
box of cards on the floor was a no-no.

<P>
While I was a programmer Monday-Friday 8-5, I flew during the remaining
waking hours.  I had gotten my private pilot's license in 1968, between
high school and college, but rarely had the time or money during college
to fly.  So as soon as I got a full-time job I got my instrument rating,
commercial license, instructor's license, multi-engine rating, instrument
instructor's rating, multi-engine instructor rating, and all three ground
instructor ratings (basic, advanced, and instrument).  I would leave work
at 5 pm, stop at a Jack in the Box off the Riverside Freeway and pick up
dinner, then to the Fullerton Airport for a student at 5:30.  Two nights
a week I taught ground school from 7-10 pm, and naturally spent most of
the weekend at the airport.  The things we do when young and single.

<P>
In 1975 I decided that there was no future in flying (airline jobs were
impossible to get, and who wants a job where you are judged only by
seniority?) and headed off to grad school.  I headed back to Ann Arbor,
still having enough contacts there to get my job back at the Computing
Center, and liking the city a lot.  But 2 weeks before I left California
I had a job interview arranged by an old friend from the U. of Michigan
Astronomy Department for a programming job at Kitt Peak Observatory in
Tucson (where my friend was working).  The interview went well, but they
couldn't give me a final answer for a few weeks.  At that point in my
life everything I owned fit into my VW bug, and away I went to Ann Arbor.
When I got to Ann Arbor I checked into a hotel, called Kitt Peak, and
they offered me the job.  One side benefit was that working at Kitt Peak
I got to attend grad school at the University of Arizona for $5 per
semester.  So the choice was living in Ann Arbor as a penniless grad
student, or working full-time in Tucson (sunshine, warmth) and going
to grad school for free.  Away I drove in my VW bug for Tucson.

<P>
I was at Kitt Peak from 1975 until 1982 and my programming included
both real-time data acquisition systems (we used the Forth language on
Varian 620/f minicomputers) and Fortran number crunching on a Control
Data 6400 mainframe.  In 1975 at an ACM conference that I attended I
bought a copy of the original Jensen and Wirth "PASCAL: User Manual and
Report".  I really liked Pascal, compared to the Fortran that I was used
to, and was able to get a free Pascal compiler for the CDC mainframe to
play with at Kitt Peak.  But trying to get scientists and engineers to
give up Fortran was a losing battle.  I later got a copy (2nd printing)
of the 1978 Kernighan and Ritchie C book, and remember reading it while
riding the Kitt Peak bus one day between Tucson and the mountain.
Wow, this new language was even better than Pascal!  I had also read
the CACM article by Ritchie and Thompson in 1975 on Unix, and figured
it was time to try to get a Unix system at Kitt Peak.  The first step
was to get an educational Unix license (commercial licenses were $20,000,
I think, for the Seventh Edition, aka Version 7) and Kitt Peak was able
to do that through the University of Arizona, thanks to
<A HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~drh/">Dave Hanson</A>.
There was also an ongoing battle at Kitt Peak to get rid of the Varians
and move to PDP-11s (what everyone else was using) so we started obtaining
some PDP-11s and somehow a PDP-11/60 was allocated for Unix.  We used to
boot the PDP-11 half the day running Forth, and the other half of the day
running Unix.  I got addicted to Unix very quickly.

<P>
In the Spring of 1980 I sat in on Dave Hanson's graduate class that went
through the Unix Version 6 source code (using the
<A HREF="http://www.peer-to-peer.com/catalog/opsrc/lions.html">Lion's book</A>).
At the same time I was doing my graduate research in image processing at the
Univ. of Arizona, and the Digital Image Analysis Lab (DIAL) had a
PDP-11/70 that my advisor
(<A HREF="http://www.ece.arizona.edu/department/profs/Bobby.R.Hunt.html">Bob
Hunt</A>) let me run Unix on in the evenings.
First I had to find a version of Unix that would boot on an 11/70 with
an RM03 disk (the release tape from Bell Labs did not boot on this disk,
because they didn't have any).  I remember going to Dave Hanson's office
to ask him.  He didn't know of such a boot tape, but turned around to
his terminal and typed out a quick email to Dennis Ritchie, asking him.
This was 1980, and my first experience with email.  The message went out
that night (uucp, when the phone rates were the lowest), and we had an
answer the next day.  No luck at Bell Labs.  I then went to the Usenix
meeting in February 1980 in Boulder and found a person there who would
send me a bootable tape for an 11/70 and an RM03: it was
<A HREF="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/">Brian Harvey</A>
from Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School in Massachusetts,
the logo wizard.
Around this same time at Kitt Peak we started buying some
VAXes, and the battle was whether to run VMS or Unix on them.  We
ended up with both, but it was clear to me that given a choice, Unix
was the programming environment that I wanted to work with.

<P>
In 1982 I finished my Ph.D.  For a few months prior finishing my
dissertation a friend who had been a professor of mine
at the Univ. of Arizona,
but had left to join a health care startup in Connecticut, kept calling
me at Kitt Peak with Unix questions.  They were considering doing all
software development at the startup in C under Unix.  He finally said
he was tired of calling me all the time, and would I like to move to
Connecticut and lead up their software team.  My wife agreed, so in
December of 1982 I turned in the final copy of my dissertation on a
Wednesday, the packers came and packed the house on Thursday, they
loaded the moving van Friday, and we left Tucson on Saturday.  The
next 8 years were spent working in New Haven for Health Systems
International, which was lots of fun, but that's another story.
