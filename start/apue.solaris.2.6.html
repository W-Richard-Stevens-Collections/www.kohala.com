<BODY>

<P>  There are two ways to create a stream pipe under SVR4
(that is, a pipe that is full-duplex and allows descriptors to
be passed across it):

<OL>
<LI>   <TT>pipe()</TT>, and
<LI>   <TT>socketpair()</TT>.

</OL>

<P>  There are two ways to pass a descriptor under SVR4:

<OL>
<LI>   The <TT>I_SENDFD</TT> and <TT>I_RECVFD</TT> <TT>ioctl</TT>s, and
<LI>   The <TT>sendmsg()</TT> and <TT>recvmsg()</TT> system calls.

</OL>

<P>  Under previous releases of SVR4 these were all interchangeable.
The implementation of sockets within the Solaris 2.6 kernel has
changed from all previous Solaris 2.x releases
and sockets no longer possess all the properties of a stream.
Portable code must not assume the streams properties of sockets in SVR4.

<P>
The file <TT>lib.svr4/spipe.c</TT> in the
source code for the book calls <TT>pipe</TT>
and the two files <TT>lib.svr4/{send,recv}fd.c</TT> call <TT>ioctl</TT>.
This is the recommended way under SVR4.

<P>
Alternately, under Solaris 2.x you can call <TT>socketpair</TT>
and then <TT>sendmsg</TT> and <TT>recvmsg</TT>,
but you need to change what files are built into the
<TT>libmisc.a</TT> library to do this.

<P>
On a Berkeley-derived kernel (e.g., 4.xBSD and SunOS 4.1.x),
you must call <TT>socketpair</TT> and then
<TT>sendmsg</TT> and <TT>recvmsg</TT>.

<P>
There are reports of people using the file <TT>lib.svr4/spipe.socket.c</TT>
(which calls <TT>socketpair()</TT> under Solaris 2.6,
and then trying to use the <TT>I_SENDFD</TT> <TT>ioctl</TT>
to pass a descriptor.
This no longer works.
