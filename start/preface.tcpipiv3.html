<H2>Introduction and Organization of the Book</H2>
<P>
This book is a logical continuation of the <I>TCP/IP Illustrated</I>
series: [Stevens 1994], which we refer to as <I>Volume 1</I>,
and [Wright and Stevens 1995], which we refer to as <I>Volume 2</I>
This book is divided into three parts,
each covering a different topic:
<OL>
<LI>
TCP for transactions, commonly called T/TCP.
This is an extension to TCP designed to make client-server
transactions faster, more efficient, and reliable.
This is done by omitting TCP's three-way handshake
at the beginning of a connection
and shortening the TIME_WAIT state at the end of a connection.
We'll see that T/TCP can match UDP's performance
for a client-server transaction
and that T/TCP provides reliability and adaptability,
both major improvements over UDP.
<P>
A transaction is defined to be a client request to a server,
followed by the server's reply.
(The term <I>transaction</I>
does not mean a database transaction,
with locking, two-phase commit, and backout.)
<P>
<LI>
TCP/IP applications,
specifically HTTP (the Hypertext Transfer Protocol,
the foundation of the World Wide Web)
and NNTP (the Network News Transfer Protocol,
the basis for the Usenet news system).
<P>
<LI>
The Unix domain protocols.
These protocols are provided by all Unix TCP/IP implementations
and on many non-Unix implementations.
They provide a form of interprocess communication (IPC)
and use the same sockets interface used with TCP/IP.
When the client and server are on the same host,
the Unix domain protocols are often twice as fast as TCP/IP.
</OL>
<P>
Part 1, the presentation of T/TCP, is in two pieces.
Chapters 1-4 describe the protocol and provide numerous
examples of how it works.
This material is a major expansion of the brief presentation of T/TCP
in Section 24.7 of Volume 1.
The second piece, Chapters 5-12,
describes the actual implementation of T/TCP within the 4.4BSD-Lite
networking code (i.e., the code presented in Volume 2).
Since the first T/TCP implementation was not released until September 1994,
about one year after Volume 1 was published and right as Volume 2 was
being completed, the detailed presentation of T/TCP,
with examples and all the implementation details,
had to wait for another volume in the series.
<P>
Part 2, the HTTP and NNTP applications,
are a continuation of the TCP/IP applications presented
in Chapters 25-30 of Volume 1.
In the two years since Volume 1 was published,
the popularity of HTTP has grown enormously,
as the Internet has exploded,
and the use of NNTP has been growing about 75% per year for more than 10 years.
HTTP is also a wonderful candidate for T/TCP,
given its typical use of TCP:
short connections with small amounts of data transferred,
where the total time is often dominated by the connection setup and teardown.
The heavy use of HTTP (and therefore TCP) on a busy Web server
by thousands of different and varied clients
also provides a unique opportunity to examine the actual packets
at the server (Chapter 14) and look at many features of TCP/IP
that were presented in Volumes 1 and 2.
<P>
The Unix domain protocols in Part 3 were originally considered
for Volume 2 but omitted when its size reached 1200 pages.
While it may seem odd to cover protocols other than TCP/IP in a series titled
<I>TCP/IP Illustrated</I>,
the Unix domain protocols were implemented almost 15 years ago
in 4.2BSD alongside the first implementation of BSD TCP/IP.
They are used heavily today in any Berkeley-derived kernel,
but their use is typically "under the covers,"
and most users are unaware of their presence.
Besides being the foundation for Unix pipes on a Berkeley-derived kernel,
another heavy user is the X Window System,
when the client and server are on the same host
(i.e., on typical workstations).
Unix domain sockets are also used to pass descriptors between processes,
a powerful technique for interprocess communication.
Since the sockets API (application program interface)
used with the Unix domain protocols
is nearly identical to the sockets API used with TCP/IP,
the Unix domain protocols provide an easy way to enhance the performance
of local applications with minimal code changes.
<P>
Each of the three parts can be read by itself.

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<HR>
<H2>Readers</H2>
<P>
As with the previous two volumes in the series,
this volume is intended for anyone wishing to understand how the
TCP/IP protocols operate:
programmers writing network applications,
system administrators responsible for maintaining computer systems
and networks utilizing TCP/IP,
and users who deal with TCP/IP applications on a daily basis.
<P>
Parts 1 and 2 assume a basic understanding of how the TCP/IP protocols work.
Readers unfamiliar with TCP/IP should consult the first volume in
this series, [Stevens 1994],
for a thorough description of the TCP/IP protocol suite.
The first half of Part 1
(Chapters 1-4, the concepts behind T/TCP along with examples)
can be read independent of Volume 2, but the remainder of Part 1
(Chapters 5-12, the implementation of T/TCP)
assumes familiarity with the 4.4BSD-Lite networking code,
as provided with Volume 2.
<P>
Many forward and backward references are provided throughout the text,
to both topics within this text,
and to relevant sections of Volumes 1 and 2
for readers interested in more details.
A thorough index is provided,
and a list of all the acronyms used throughout the text,
along with the compound term for the acronym,
appears on the inside front covers.
The inside back covers contain an alphabetical cross-reference
of all the structures, functions, and macros described in the book
and the starting page number of the description.
This cross-reference also refers to definitions in Volume 2,
when that object is referenced from the code in this volume.
