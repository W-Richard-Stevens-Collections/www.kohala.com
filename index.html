<h3>October 3, 1999</h3>
<P>
After being out of service for several weeks, I'm pleased to announce
that www.kohala.com is back.  The site has been relocated with
minimal changes to the content.
The material that was previously located at Rich's Home page
(http://www.kohala.com/~rstevens) can now be found at:
<A href="start/index.html">http://www.kohala.com/start/</a>
</P>
For those of you who may be unaware, Rich Stevens passed away on
September 1, 1999.  The site was unavailable while details regarding
the content and Internet access for the site were worked out.
<P>
I'm happy to be able to make Rich's material available again for
his many readers and students.  Rich received large amounts of
email regarding Unix and TCP/IP.  I'm not able to spend nearly as
much time as Rich did reading and corresponding with his readers, but
will do my best to respond.

<blockquote>
Kohala is a name from the Big Island of Hawai'i.
The name appears in a number of places.
First, the island is divided into nine districts.
On the West coast, going from South to North the districts are
South Kona, North Kona, South Kohala, and North Kohala.
Kohala is also the name of the fourth highest (and oldest)
volcano on the island, which is in the Kohala Mountains,
running from Hawi to Waimea.
The coastal area north of Kona (in the South Kohala district)
is often called the "Kohala coast".
